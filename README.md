## 1. Convex Hull

![Architectural Design](./pictures/download.jpeg)

### Project Description
The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex shape enclosing all the given points without any inward angles greater than 180 degrees. It represents the outer boundary that forms a convex polygon or polyhedron, essential in computational geometry for various algorithms involving point sets, such as collision detection, spatial analysis, and computational geometry problems. To accomplish this, Graham's scan algorithm is impleted to find the convex hull.

### Graham's Scan Algorithm

1. **Given a set of points, sort through and find the lowest Y coordinate value. If there are multiple, use the lowest X value among them. This one point will be the anchor point.

2. **Sort the remaing points by the angle they form with the anchor point going from smallest to largest starting with the anchor point. If two angles are the same, put the smallest distance from the anchor point first.

3. **If there are less than 3 data points, the convel hull is unable to be found.

4. **Create a vector to store the points that will form the convex hull. Push the anchor point and the next data point from the sorted list to the convex hull vector.

5. **Start with the third data point and anaylze the orientation of this point with the previous 2. If the orientation of these 3 points are counter-clockwise, add it to the convex hull vector. If not, move on to the next point and continue to analyaze that point with the previous 2.

6. **Print out the components of the convex hull.

### Expected Outcomes

At the conclusion of this project, you will have developed a significant architectural design that effectively integrates recursive patterns and fractal aesthetics. This experience will deepen your understanding of applying mathematical concepts to real-world architectural design challenges, including balancing innovative design with structural integrity.
